The perfect way to learn Vue.js is to use Vue.js. It's an incremental library that can scale to fit almost any developer's needs. Once you build an application interface and see its strengths and flexibility in action, you can decide how much of Vue.js you want to use in your own projects. This hands-on course teaches you how to build a simple component-based app: a rating system with features like search and sorting. Along the way, Ray Villalobos shows how to use Vue.js lifecycle methods to load data from files or an API; leverage HTML templates; work with nested subcomponents; add, edit, and delete records throughout the interface; and build layouts to search records and sort the displayed results. By the end of the course, you'll have a functional app prototype and more skills with this flexible framework.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at. 

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspod to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course. 

## Documentation
If there are slides for this course, they will be available using the `gh-pages` branch. You can easily get to the slides by going to http://raybo.org/vueinterface. The slides were created using [rayveal.js](https://github.com/planetoftheweb/rayveal) an opinionated version of the excellent reveal.js framework. Within these slides you can also read my notes for the project, just hit `ctrl-m` to get a menu with all of the slides for the project.
